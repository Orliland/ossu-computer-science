# OSSU Computer Science

This project aims to create a more user-friendly version of the Computer Science curriculum created by [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), so that more users can access it and reduce the dropout rate by self-taught students.

## Next steps

- [ ] Create a landing page for new students to learn about the project, its objectives and benefits.
- [ ] [Nextra Remote Docs Support](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-3#remote-docs-support) Implement remote document reading to ensure that the curriculum is always updated to the latest version of the official repository.
- [ ] Integrate progress tracking system with authentication, maybe something like [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info) tutorial map.
